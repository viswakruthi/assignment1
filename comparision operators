Comparision operators are used to give the relation between 2 operands
types of comparision operators:
<less than
>greater than
>=greater than equals to
<=lesser than equals to
==equals to
!=not equals to
example:
a=10,b=5
a>b
RETURN TRUE
greater than operation 
a=5,b=10
RETURN TRUE
lesser than operation
a=5,b=10
b>=a
RETURN TRUE
greater than equals to operation
b=10,a=5
a<=5
RETURN TRUE
lesser than equals to operation
a=5,b=10
a!=b
RETURN TRUE
not equal to operation
a=5,b=5
a==b
RETURN TRUE
equals to operation
